## Proposed Android App for EEG-Based Alexithymia Screening and Monitoring
### Alexithymia and Its EEG Correlates
What is Alexithymia: Alexithymia is a personality trait characterized by difficulty in identifying and describing one’s emotions, confusion between emotional feelings and bodily sensations, limited imaginative ability, and an externally oriented thinking style . In practice, people with alexithymia often struggle to recognize their own emotions and communicate them, which can impact mental health and therapy outcomes. It is typically assessed by self-report questionnaires (e.g. the 20-item Toronto Alexithymia Scale), but these subjective measures have limitations in objectivity and insight . This has driven research into more objective, neurophysiological measures of alexithymia using EEG.
